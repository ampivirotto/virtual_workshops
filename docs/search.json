    "text": "Step 1: Collecting Texts from Project Gutenberg\nIn this section, you will learn how to pull Jane Austen novels from Project Gutenberg for analysis. The full version (available in Colab) includes all necessary code and explanations to download the text directly from Project Gutenberg.\n Launch Full Notebook in Colab \nIn the cell below, we give an example of how you might define the list of Jane Austen’s novels by title or ID number. This can then be used to download several different texts from Project Gutenberg at once. However, for this example we start with a single book “Pride and Prejudice” and we show how you can use the requests package to download the text.\n\nNote: The example below shows how you’d do this with requests in a full Python environment (Colab or Binder). Browser Pyodide sessions cannot use the requests library to make arbitrary network calls so this can only be completed in a full python environment.\n\njane_austen_book_titles = [\"Pride and Prejudice\", \"Sense and Sensibility\", \"Emma\"] ## Option 1: by title\njane_austen_book_ids = [1342, 161, 158]  ## Option 2: by Gutenberg ID number\n\n## let's start with downloading one book as an example\nbook_id = jane_austen_book_ids[0]  # Pride and Prejudice\n\nimport requests ## to make HTTP requests\nbook_url = f\"https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/{book_id}/pg{book_id}.txt\"\n\nresponse = requests.get(book_url) ## this makes the call to the website to download the text\nif response.status_code == 200: # check if the request was successful\n    book_text = response.text\n    print(f\"Successfully downloaded book ID {book_id}\")\nelse:\n    print(f\"Failed to download book ID {book_id}\")\nNotice how we downloaded the text file by making an HTTP GET request to the Gutenberg website. The text is then stored in the book_text variable for further analysis. We can do a quick sanity check to make sure we’re downloading the correct file by following the link we created: Notice how we downloaded the text file by making an HTTP GET request to the Gutenberg website.
